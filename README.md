# shakey

Currently pretty broken! This is a project I built a year and a half ago that I decided to move over to swift. It accesses a bunch of really awkward iOS APIs, features pretty much every communication pattern, and is ripe for a solid refactoring. 

This Swiftified version is also far from complete in features - currently it will only show a single pic, the buttons aren't there/do nothing, and no networking is implemented yet.
